# AI Instructions - Code Style & Convention Guide

## Document Overview

This document defines the **coding standards, conventions, and best practices** for the programming projects. All AI-assisted code generation and human-written code should adhere to these guidelines to maintain consistency, readability, and maintainability across the codebase.

---

## Purpose and Scope

### Primary Goals
- Establish consistent naming conventions across the entire codebase
- Define structural patterns for common scenarios (Singleton, initialization, etc.)
- Prevent common code quality issues (magic numbers, exception misuse)
- Ensure code readability and maintainability

### Target Audience
- **GitHub Copilot**: Primary consumer of these instructions
- **AI Code Assistants**: Any AI tool working on this codebase
- **Human Developers**: Reference guide for manual coding
- **Code Reviewers**: Standard for evaluating pull requests
