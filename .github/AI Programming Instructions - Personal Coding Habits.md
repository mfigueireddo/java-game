# AI Instructions - Personal Coding Habits

## Naming Conventions

### Method Names
- Use PascalCase for all method names
- Examples: `GetGamePanel()`, `UpdatePlayer()`, `RenderGraphics()`

### Variable and Field Names
- Use snake_case for all variable and field names
- Examples: `game_panel`, `player_position`, `enemy_count`

### Constants
- Use UPPER_SNAKE_CASE for all constants (final static variables)
- Examples: `MAX_HEALTH`, `DEFAULT_SPEED`, `MIN_WIDTH`

### Descriptive Names
- Avoid abbreviations - use full, descriptive names
- Examples:
  - ✅ `enemy_health`, `maximum_velocity`
  - ❌ `en_hlth`, `max_vel`
- Avoid single-letter names, even in loops
- Examples:
  - ✅ `for (int row = 0; row < height; row++)`
  - ✅ `for (int index = 0; index < list.size(); index++)`
  - ✅ `for (int column = 0; column < width; column++)`
  - ❌ `for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)`

## Singleton Pattern

- When creating a singleton class, place the GetInstance() method first in the class
- Order: static instance field, GetInstance() method, then constructor and other methods

## Variable Initialization

- Initialize member variables at declaration, not in the constructor
- Example: `private final JButton new_game = new JButton("New Game");`
- Keep constructors focused on setup and configuration logic

## Magic Numbers

- Never use magic numbers directly in code
- Always create final variables with descriptive names for all numeric values
- This includes: dimensions, sizes, margins, padding, thickness, colors, etc.
- Examples:
  - `final int buttons_width = 200;`
  - `final int buttons_height = 40;`
  - `final int buttons_vbox_border_thickness = 10;`
  - `final int buttons_vbox_margin = 10;`
- Group related constants together in the code for clarity

## Exception Handling

- Use exceptions ONLY for extreme cases when the program is at risk of improper behavior
- Exceptions should be reserved for situations that cannot be handled through normal control flow
- For expected conditions and validation, prefer explicit checks and error handling without exceptions

## General Programming Principles

### Memory Management and Performance

#### Recursion
- **Never use recursion**
- Prevents being stuck in infinite recursion and wasting memory

#### Heap Usage
- **Avoid heap usage when possible**
- Reduces the risk of memory leaks

#### Pointer Ownership (C++)
- **Use `std::unique_ptr` and similar smart pointers to move objects**
- Explicitly indicates ownership transfer
- Example: `std::unique_ptr<Player> player_ptr = std::make_unique<Player>();`

### Loop Safety

#### While Loop Iteration Limits
- **Always limit the number of iterations in while loops**
- This prevents the program from being stuck in an infinite loop if something goes wrong
- **Always create code to handle when this limitation is triggered**
- Example:
  ```cpp
  int max_iterations = 1000;
  int iteration_count = 0;
  while (condition && iteration_count < max_iterations) {
      // loop body
      iteration_count++;
  }
  if (iteration_count >= max_iterations) {
      // Handle loop limit reached
      LogError("While loop exceeded maximum iterations");
  }
  ```

### Variable and Scope Management

#### Variable Scope
- **Limit variable access to the smallest scope possible**
- Makes the code easier to maintain
- Declare variables as close as possible to where they are used

#### Lambda Function Captures
- **Never use references in lambda function captures in any language**
- Prevents code from failing if a variable is removed, has its position switched, or can't be accessed when the lambda function is called
- Prefer capturing by value or using smart pointers
- Example:
  - ✅ `[](Health player_health) { return player_health > 0; }`
  - ❌ `[&]() { return player_health > 0; }`

#### Type Inference (C++)
- **Use `auto` to make code cleaner and more readable**
- **Exception 1**: Never use `auto` for numeric types (int, float, double)
  - It's critically important to be explicit with numeric types to avoid rounding mistakes
- **Exception 2**: Never use `auto` when a function can return more than one data type
- Examples:
  - ✅ `auto game_panel = GamePanel::GetInstance();`
  - ✅ `int player_score = 100;`
  - ❌ `auto player_score = 100;`
  - ❌ `auto payment = PaymentFactory::CreatePayment()`

### Code Quality and Debugging

#### Debug Logging
- **Never commit code with debug logs**
- This includes functions like: `print()`, `printf()`, `console.log()`, `System.out.println()`, etc.
- **Exception**: This rule can be ignored if the project explicitly uses the terminal/console for communication with the user

#### Function Return Values
- **Always check the return value of a function call**
- If the function returns void, make this explicit in code
- Example in C: `(void)some_function();`

### Compilation and Build Standards

#### Compiler Warnings
- **Always compile code with warnings activated**
- **Prefer compilation settings that treat warnings as errors**
- Examples:
  - C/C++: Use `-Wpedantic` and `-Werror`
  - Java: Use `-Xlint:all` and `-Werror`
- This ensures code quality and catches potential issues early

#### Code Formatting
- **Guarantee that indentation is uniform across all code**
- **Configure the IDE's TAB behavior to use 4 spaces**
- Maintain consistency across all files in the project

#### Macro Usage
- **Avoid using macros as conditions or flags**
- Macro flags exponentially increase the test cases necessary to cover the whole system's behavior
- Prefer const variables, enums, or configuration classes instead

#### Compile-Time Constants
- **Use language resources like `inline constexpr` when creating variables that have their value known at the beginning of the program and won't be modified**
- This is a great substitution for MACROS
- Provides type safety and better debugging compared to preprocessor macros
- Examples:
  - C++: `inline constexpr int file_path = "src/images/tree.png";`
  - C++: `inline constexpr double PI = 3.14159265359;`
- Benefits: type checking, scoping rules, and debugger visibility

### Object-Oriented Design

#### Parent Classes
- **When creating a parent class, make it abstract**
- This makes the code's behavior more explicit
- Forces intentional design decisions about which classes should be instantiated
